I am renaming this to sandbox.  All the fun I have learning to code and play with ideas goes in here. I am learning about Angular 2 from pluralsight.  Already watched the getting started videos by Deborah Korata.  Learning to be a proficent programer is now my passion, my pain and the reason I drag myself out of bed in the morning.  

I am creating this readme file so I can track my learning progress.  I wish myself the strength to push through when the going gets tough.  Not to give up on my dream of programing for a living.  To use my mind and not just my body.  To make a difference in my own life.  Welcome to the journey for I will never write the destination.
