I am renaming this to sandbox.  All the fun I have learning to code and play with ideas goes in here. I am learning about Angular 2 from pluralsight.  Already watched the getting started videos by Deborah Korata.  Learning to be a proficent programer is now my passion, my pain and the reason I drag myself out of bed in the morning.  

I am creating this readme file so I can track my learning progress.  I wish myself the strength to push through when the going gets tough.  Not to give up on my dream of programing for a living.  To use my mind and not just my body.  To make a difference in my own life.  Welcome to the journey for I will never write the destination.

I am working more on my pluralsight training for Angular 2.  I have rebuilt this repository to contain all my trial stuff.  Hopefully this will be painless to upload to git.

Working on project for UAA called EodDashboard.  It will display graphs for sensors in the EIB building.  I want to get the graphing done soon.  Yeah.

I am going to be pulling the different projects out into different repositories.  Also I am going to make a simple website hosted on git hub for now.
